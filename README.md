Responsive website HTML/CSS


Hello! 

This is a basic website that I created while practicing on responsiveness for websites.

I watched one of Kevin Powell's videos on web design for this project. 

Here is the link of his great Youtube channel!

On the tutorial video I discovered the Custom properties, wich allow you to store and retrive value from properties that you define yourfel. 

I found this tool extremely useful as you do not have to memorise things like color codes, etc. You can define the properties the way you want to.

I also enjoyed his take on Flex's properties and how he used them to apply resposiveness to the website.


Enjoy!
